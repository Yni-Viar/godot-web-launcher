# Godot Web installer and launcher.

Since Godot 4.5 removes support for Windows 7-8.x, I "ported" Web editor, using Electron (since v.2.0, 1.0 is UNSAFE!!!).

## Building

Run build-godot-web.bat to quickly build the app and launch.

⚠️ Currently, this batch script is useless, because the next Godot version did not even release.
